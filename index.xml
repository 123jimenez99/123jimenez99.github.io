      <description>Over the years I’ve been making a small list of content creators that really are worth giving them a watch, most of them are related to technology and are definitely not involved on shilling.
Jeff Geerling He likes Raspberry Pis quite a bit, and hence he does many very interesting projects with them. The coolest one in my opinion is when he made a portable cluster of Pis and hosted his webpage on a rural area using nothing more than a few solar panels and an LTE SIM card.</description>

      <description>Greetings! My name is Asier Jiménez. I&amp;rsquo;m a 20-year-old IT student amazed by topics such as Open Source, Linux, Homebrew, Hardware Offloading, GP-GPU, exotic CPU architectures, and more!
I’m currently studying an Advanced Systems Administration degree, although I plan to get the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator degree in addition to the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator degree and the B2 English certification in the future.
Not only that, but I like to spend my time learning whenever I have the opportunity.</description>
