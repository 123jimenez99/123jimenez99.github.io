      <description>I’m currently studying an Advanced Systems Administration degree, although I plan to get the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator degree in addition to the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator degree and the C1 Advanced English certification in the future.
I like to spend my time learning whenever I have the opportunity. Right now I’m familiarizing with modern and powerful technologies such as Docker, Git, Ansible, Kubernetes and Grafana.
I’ll be more than open to work for you as a junior sysadmin or something related during summer, from 2023 and onwards.</description>

      <description>Nowadays popular content on YouTube generally is garbage. Don’t you believe me? Visit the main YouTube page without cookies, “just open a youtube.com tab in an incognito window” and you will see ultra saturated thumbnails with people with their mouths open. I know, terrible.
But don’t worry, over the years I’ve been making a small list of content creators that really are worth giving them a watch, most of them are related to technology.</description>
