      <description>Over the years I‚Äôve been making a small list of content creators that really are worth giving them a watch, most of them are related to technology and are definitely not involved on shilling.
Jeff Geerling He likes Raspberry Pis quite a bit, and hence he does many very interesting projects with them. The coolest one in my opinion is when he made a portable cluster of Pis and hosted his webpage on a rural area using nothing more than a few solar panels and an LTE SIM card.</description>

      <description>Hello thereüëãüèº, my name is Asier Jim√©nez. I am a sysadmin student interested in Open Source, Linux, homebrew, hardware offloading, and GPGPU computing.
I like to spend my spare time learning modern and widely used technologies such as Git, Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible, mainly because of how powerful these tools are. I look forward to continuing to prepare for various certifications such as AWS SysOps Certification, Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator, and C1 English Certification.</description>
