      <description>Nowadays popular content on YouTube generally is garbage. Don’t you believe me? Visit the main YouTube page without cookies, “just open a youtube.com tab in an incognito window” and you will see ultra saturated thumbnails with people with their mouths open. I know, terrible.
But don’t worry, over the years I’ve been making a small list of content creators that really are worth giving them a watch, most of them are related to technology.</description>

      <description>Hi and welcome to my humble website! My name is Asier Jiménez. I&amp;rsquo;m a 19-year-old IT student amazed by topics such as Open Source, Linux, Homebrew, Hardware Offloading, GP-GPU, exotic CPU architectures, and more!
I’m currently studying an Advanced Systems Administration degree while I study for the Cambridge B2 English certificate. I also plan on getting the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator certificate in addition to the LPIC-2 in the future.</description>
