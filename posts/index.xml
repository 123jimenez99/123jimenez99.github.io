      <description>Have you ever wondered what the fate of the Cell processor would have been like if the software designed for it could have been coded making use of the compilers we have today? In this article, I will explain the complications and limitations of the Cell processor, as well as how a modern compiler can drastically help optimize the code for it.
Before we proceed, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly take a look at the design of the Cell processor: The Cell processor consists of a scalar dual-threaded PowerPC core (PPE) and eight vector coprocessors (SPE) that communicate via an internal bus (EIB).</description>
